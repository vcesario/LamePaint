-----------------------------------------------------------------

To do:

- [x] Main menu layout
- [x] Bottom bar layout
- [x] Functioning FPS counter
- [x] Functioning mouse coordinates

- [x] Simple round brush (black ink on white canvas)
    - [x] Create texture and load it into memory
    - [x] draw circles around mouse position directly to texture that is already loaded
    - [x] do the above while clicking
    - [x] While dragging, draw "lines" (as squares) between the circles
- [x] Colored round brush (numbers change color as debug)
    - [x] fix colors (black brush is kinda greyish right now. it's because of linear filtering... proper scaling of the texture should solve this, probably)
    - [x] pressing numbers change painting color
- [] Tools layout
- [] Functioning colors

Depending on how quick I do this, I could add:
