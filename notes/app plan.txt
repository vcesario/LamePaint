-----------------------------------------------------------------

To do:

- [x] Main menu layout
- [x] Bottom bar layout
- [x] Functioning FPS counter
- [x] Functioning mouse coordinates

- [x] Simple round brush (black ink on white canvas)
    - [x] Create texture and load it into memory
    - [x] draw circles around mouse position directly to texture that is already loaded
    - [x] do the above while clicking
    - [x] While dragging, draw "lines" (as squares) between the circles
- [x] Colored round brush (numbers change color as debug)
    - [x] fix colors (black brush is kinda greyish right now. it's because of linear filtering... proper scaling of the texture should solve this, probably)
    - [x] pressing numbers change painting color
- [] Tools
    - [] Draggable tools menu with containing:
        * Round brush (panel wide button)
        * Eraser (panel wide button)
        * Bucket (panel wide button)
        * Brush size (Number box)
        * Brush color palette (grid aligned squares of fixed size, can auto reorder depending on panel width)
    - [] Functioning Eraser (it's just a second state brush)
        - [] X key is a shortcut to swap between both
    - [] Functioning brush size
    - [] Functioning colors
    - [] Menu icons
    - [] Cursor customization
    - [] Functioning bucket (maybe flood fill algo?)

- [] Exit menu option
- [] New menu option
- [] Open menu option
- [] Export menu option

- [] Final code review

- [] Bugfixes
    - [] Pixel coordinates shouldn't update while hovering top and bottom bars
    - [] If I drag out of screen too fast, it discards the rectangle

If I feel like it:
- Fix bug where sometimes rectangles arent rasterized. Maybe a tool that draws in slowmo as it logs current steps on console....
- Color picker
- Zoom
- Undo
- Resize
