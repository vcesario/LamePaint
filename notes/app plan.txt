-----------------------------------------------------------------

To do:

- [x] Main menu layout
- [x] Bottom bar layout
- [x] Functioning FPS counter
- [x] Functioning mouse coordinates

- [x] Simple round brush (black ink on white canvas)
    - [x] Create texture and load it into memory
    - [x] draw circles around mouse position directly to texture that is already loaded
    - [x] do the above while clicking
    - [x] While dragging, draw "lines" (as squares) between the circles
- [x] Colored round brush (numbers change color as debug)
    - [x] fix colors (black brush is kinda greyish right now. it's because of linear filtering... proper scaling of the texture should solve this, probably)
    - [x] pressing numbers change painting color
- [] Tools
    - [x] Draggable tools menu with containing:
        * Round brush (panel wide button)
        * Eraser (panel wide button)
        * Bucket (panel wide button)
        * Brush size (Number box)
        * Brush color palette (grid aligned squares of fixed size, can auto reorder depending on panel width)
    - [x] Functioning Eraser 
        - [x] Add "eraser" (it's just a second state brush)
        - [x] X key is a shortcut to swap between both
    - [x] Functioning brush size
    - [x] Functioning colors
    - [x] Menu icons
    - [] Cursor customization
        - [] quad that follows mouse position
        - [] quad texture
        - [] quad texture changes size/color based on brush
        - [] frag shader that draws circle on quad
        - [] paint bucket icon
        - [] hide mouse when on canvas, show when on UI or outside of window

    - [] Functioning bucket (maybe flood fill algo?)

- [] Exit menu option
- [] New menu option
- [] Open menu option
- [] Export menu option

- [] Final code review
    - [] update to C++20 to use new std::format
    - [] Better separation of concerns to improve extensibility. Namespaces, maybe UI could have its own class?
    - [] Refactor UI palette drawing to remove duplicate code
    - [] Refactor vector math in rasterization algo

- [] Bugfixes
    - [] Pixel coordinates shouldn't update while hovering top and bottom bars
    - [] If I drag out of screen too fast, it discards the rectangle
    - [] Tools menu should block drawing

If I feel like it:
- Fix bug where sometimes rectangles arent rasterized. Maybe a tool that draws in slowmo as it logs current steps on console....
- Color picker
- Zoom
- Undo
- Resize
